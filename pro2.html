            <h2>Binary Clock</h2>
            <p>A binary clock is a clock that displays the time of day in a binary format. This projects aproach is the same as binary-coded decimal clocks, where is used six columns of LEDs to represent zeros and ones. Each column represents a single decimal digit, a format known as binary-coded decimal (BCD). Each row represents powers of two, from 2^0 (or 1), up to 2^3 (or 8). So all you have to do when reading the clock is to sum the value of the row if the LED is on. For instance, the first column from the right to the left of the image above have the 8-LED and the 1-LED turned on, adding 8 with 1 you get 9, so the ones of the seconds is 9, next column is the tens of the seconds, and the only turned on is the 4-LED, so you end up with a total value of 49 seconds, and the same for minutes and hours. Please note that here the hour is shown in the 24-h format.</p>
