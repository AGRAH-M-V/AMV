            <h2>Parkinson's Spoon</h2>
            <p>Parkinson's disease is one of the most commonly occurring neurodegenerative disorders, ranking 2nd after Alzheimer's affecting largely senior people and characterized by significant nerve cell degeneration that limits motion and daily activities. While the usual age of onset is 60 years, persons as young as 18 years old have been diagnosed. Unintentional shaking and tremors in the hand may be the patient's initial symptoms, making it hard for them to do ordinary actions such as eating food from a spoon. The goal of this project is to produce a stabilising spoon for Parkinson's disease patients so they can eat comfortably despite suffering tremors since it compensates for the user's movement. The major goal of this project is to provide a more accessible and less expensive alternative to the existing smart spoons in the industry, which is just as effective and hence beneficial to society.</p>
